---

## Overview

This project is a clone of [Spylt.com](https://www.spylt.com/), created as a learning exercise to master advanced GSAP animations and smooth scrolling techniques. My primary focus was on implementing complex animations and understanding how to create engaging user experiences with GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

**Live Demo:** [milky-motion.vercel.app](https://milky-motion.vercel.app)  
**GitHub Repo:** [GSAP_Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jimit8929/GSAP_Project)

> **Disclaimer:** This is an educational project created solely for practicing GSAP animations. All design and content credits belong to the original Spylt website and its creators.
